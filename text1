AIM:. Write a script called addnames that is to be called as follows
./addnames ulist username
Here ulist is the name of the file that contains list of user names
 and username is a
particular student's username. The script should
 check that the correct number of arguments was received and print 
a message, in case the
number of arguments is incorrect
 check whether the ulist file exists and print an error message if it 
does not
 check whether the username already exists in the file.
 If the username exists, print a
message stating that the name already exists. 
Otherwise, add the username to the end of the list.

#!/bin/bash
if [ $# != 2 ];
then
echo "argument passing error...requires 2 arguments"
exit

if [ -e $1 ];
then
file_name=$1
user_name=$2
if grep -q $user_name $file_name;
then
echo "the given username is already exist in the file"
exit

echo $user_name>>$file_name
echo "username is successfully added"
